spring-security-trivial
=======================

Just playing around with spring security stuff


Project demonstrates integration Spring Security (version 3.2) with Spring MVC.
More highlights:

    1. Spring Security Namespace Configuration
    
    2. Spring Security Tags
    
    3. Handling of Access Denied
    
    4. Spring MVC annotated request controllers
    
    5. Different home pages for different roles
    
    6. Running application with embedded tomcat plugin


How to run:

    - from command line: mvn tomcat7:run
    
    - from IntelliJ IDEA: Run configuration is already in place - trivial-security[tomcat7:run], just clink on button to have it run;


URL to access web app:
http://localhost:8080/SecuredPages

Enjoy :)
